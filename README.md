<span style="color: #6d2ac6">**AtomicCore**</span> is just a library mod that is necessary to run other mods from **The Atomic Series**.
 
## Description

This mod contains some code that is used by other mods from that series, so if you want them to work, you should install this one as well!\
However, there are also functionalities that are not required for other mods to work, but may be still useful in the game or just waiting to be used. <span style="color: #b90000">So be careful if you want to use such features in your own project as there is a chance that they will be removed in future releases of the library!</span>

## Downloads

[Minecraft 1.19.4](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/atomiccore/files/all?filter-game-version=2020709689:9776 "Then just click download ;)")
